Reallocation towards high-labour-share sectors offsets around half of the decline in the aggregate labour share since the mid-1980s, an order of magnitude larger than previous studies. Declining labour shares within sectors are still an important force driving the decline in the aggregate labour share, but the contributions are not as large as previously thought. The reason is the commonly used shift-share decomposition does not explicitly account for simultaneous reallocation between sectors with different labour share levels and within-sector changes in labour shares. As a result, the shift-share decomposition terms intended to capture reallocation and within-sector contributions also capture the co-movement between sectoral weights and labour shares. By using the Haltiwanger decomposition, I explicitly account for the mismeasurement and recover the missing reallocation effect.
